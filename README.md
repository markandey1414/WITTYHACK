## Introduction
The project aims at developing a Peer-to-Peer Electricity Trading platform through Blockchain.
There is a surplus need for electricity in remote locations, especially cold military zones like remote villages, mountains, terrains, deserts etc. Apart from this, there are also plenty of resources available to 'distribute' their energy. However, there is no proper communication flow available to make the same possible. 
Hence to utilize the potential of energy trading, we introduce a peer to peer energy trading platform that is deployed on Ethereum using smart contracts to ensure a fluent transaction between the 'Buyer' and the 'Seller'.
One major future scope of our project is the ability to transfer power between electric vehicles. Considering the miscalculation on the driver's side which may lead to power being utilized completely, en route vehicles will be able to donate their excess energy to the vehicles in need. (Extreme future)


## features
Smart Contracts enable the users to:
1. Trade energy for their money
2. Allott specific role to every user, whether they are buye or seller
Blockchain also provides quick & real-time settlements for DeMarket.

## Getting Started
This is a frontend part of the project (an electricity trading platform to trade electricity in exchange of ethereum)
Buyer and Seller are two entities here. Seller being the one who sells his/her excess electricity and Buyer being the ones in need. Urgent cases are supported first. Consider 2 situations
> A. Light needed in military zone (say, Ladakh) when in military conflict and,

> B. Light needed in remote villages of Arunachal or Rajasthan etc.

### Why Blockchain?
Blockchain provides considerably smooth and secure transactions while being decentralized over the traditional system of exchange.
It can automate billing system efficiently for local DER & peers.
